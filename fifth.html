        Once you have mastered the use of topic sentences, you may decide that the topic sentence for a particular
        paragraph
        really shouldn’t be the first sentence of the paragraph. This is fine—the topic sentence can actually go at the
        beginning, middle, or end of a paragraph; what’s important is that it is in there somewhere so that readers know
        what the main idea of the paragraph is and how it relates back to the thesis of your paper.

        Suppose that we
        wanted
        to start the piranha paragraph with a transition sentence—something that reminds the reader of what happened in
        the
        previous paragraph—rather than with the topic sentence. Let’s suppose that the previous paragraph was about all
        kinds of animals that people are afraid of, like sharks, snakes, and spiders.
