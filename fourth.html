        Despite the fact that piranhas are relatively harmless, many people continue to believe the pervasive myth that
        piranhas are dangerous to humans. This impression of piranhas is exacerbated by their mischaracterization in
        popular
        media. For example, the promotional poster for the 1978 horror film Piranha features an oversized piranha poised
        to
       
        unnecessary fear. While the trope of the man-eating piranhas lends excitement to the adventure stories, it bears
        little resemblance to the real-life piranha. By paying more attention to fact than fiction, humans may finally
        be
        able to let go of this inaccurate belief.
